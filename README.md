## ✨ Features

* **Clean Architecture:**  The project follows a well-defined architecture separating frontend (React), backend (Node.js), and user data storage.
* **Scalable Design:**  Built to handle increasing amounts of data and user accounts.
* **Organized Structure:**  Files are neatly organized into dedicated directories for easy navigation and maintenance.
* **Efficient File Handling:**  Optimized for storing and retrieving files efficiently.  (Further details on specific optimizations would go here if applicable).

## 🚀 Installation

This project consists of both a frontend and backend component.  You'll need to install both independently.

**Backend:**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samiul-Islam-123/file-nest.git
   cd file-nest/backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure `.env` (Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your database credentials and other necessary configurations).
4. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

**Frontend:**

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🛠️ Usage

The backend provides APIs for file management.  The frontend utilizes these APIs to provide a user interface.  (A more detailed explanation of specific API endpoints and UI functionalities would be added here).
